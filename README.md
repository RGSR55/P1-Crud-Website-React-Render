# P1-Crud-Website-React-Render
Simple full-stack full-CRUD website made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP, MySql, can perform editing, creation, deletion, read and many more operations, such as triggers in the database. The components are displayed on the main page in the highlight sections (suggestions, top sales, brands) using JavaScript Fetch API and the simple react form (created nested React elements using  Map function and render it on browser using ReactDOM.render() method).

This project was my first ever and was created as the final assignment for the Web Development course. It was mostly a practice project focused on CRUD operations for data management and address the concepts of APIs/JSON data/React, with a future need to improve UX/UI design. 

This website features robust CRUD functionality that enables an admin to create, read, update and delete products, categories, and brands. The admin panel allows users and sales management. The products are displayed on the main page using the JavaScript Fetch API: getting data from MySQL with PHP, convert it to JSON data (json_encode), and render it (ReactDOM.createRoot) in React components, forming a structured UI dynamically displayed at the element with ID "root" on the client-side.
